In this repo, we use spark streaming to pull the flow information from PCAP files that are being
written live to MapR FS.

Eventually, this will hopefully be able to deal with very high ingest rate, multiple 40Gbps interfaces being captured.

TODO
=====

* Push flow data into Elasticsearch or Solr with each batch

** Include a directory path for the files

* Good naming convention for the pcap filenames so we can pull them back

* Dashboard the flow data in Kibana
